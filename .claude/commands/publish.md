Execute the complete publish workflow as defined in CLAUDE.md:

1. Git commit with an appropriate commit message based on recent changes
2. Git push to the repository
3. Rebuild the project using ./build.sh
4. Create a GitHub release using gh CLI with the proper format

Ask me for the version number and what changes to include in the release notes before proceeding.
